    "question": "What is the difference between hashing and encryption?",
    "answer": "Hashing is a one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string (hash) and cannot be reversed to get the original data. It’s mainly used for data integrity. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function that encodes data into ciphertext, which can be decrypted back using a key. Encryption ensures confidentiality, while hashing ensures integrity."

  "id": "54",
  "question": "What is the difference between VA (Vulnerability Assessment) and PT (Penetration Testing)?",
  "answer": "Penetration testing is performed to find vulnerabilities, malicious content, bugs, and risks. It is used to strengthen an organization's security system by simulating real attacks on IT infrastructure. This is an official and ethical process focused on breaching systems to identify weaknesses.\n\nVulnerability assessment, on the other hand, is the process of identifying and evaluating security weaknesses in a system. It involves scanning for known vulnerabilities and assessing their severity, helping organizations to prioritize and address risks before they can be exploited."
},
  {
  "id": "55",
  "question": "What is RSA?",
  "answer": "The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. Asymmetric means that it actually works with two different keys: a public key and a private key. As the name suggests, the public key is shared with everyone, while the private key remains secret."
},
 {
  "id": "56",
  "question": "What is the Blowfish algorithm?",
  "answer": "Blowfish is an encryption technique developed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as an alternative to the DES encryption technique. It is considerably faster than DES and provides excellent encryption speed even though no effective cryptanalysis techniques have been discovered so far. It was one of the first secure block ciphers to be patent-free and therefore freely available to everyone."
},
  {
  "id": "57",
  "question": "What is the difference between a vulnerability and an exploit?",
  "answer": "Vulnerability: A vulnerability is an error in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to cause unexpected or undesirable behaviour. There are many ways a computer can become vulnerable to security threats. A common vulnerability is for attackers to exploit system security vulnerabilities to gain access to systems without proper authentication.\nExploit: Exploits are tools that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities. They are created using vulnerabilities. Exploits are often patched by software vendors as soon as they are released. They take the form of software or code that helps control computers and steal network data."
},
 {
  "id": "58",
  "question": "What do you understand by Risk, Vulnerability and threat in a network?",
  "answer": "Cyber threats are malicious acts aimed at stealing or corrupting data or destroying digital networks and systems. A threat can also be defined as the possibility of a successful cyberattack to gain unethical access to sensitive data on a system.\nVulnerabilities in cybersecurity are deficiencies in system designs, security procedures, internal controls, etc. that can be exploited by cybercriminals. In very rare cases, cyber vulnerabilities are the result of cyberattacks rather than network misconfigurations.\nCyber risk is the potential result of loss or damage to assets or data caused by cyber threats. You can't eliminate risk completely, but you can manage it to a level that meets your organization's risk tolerance. Therefore, our goal is not to build a system without risk but to keep the risk as low as possible."
},
  {
    "id": "59",
    "question": " Explain Phishing and how to prevent it.",
    "answer": "Phishing is a type of cyber attack. The name phishing comes from the word 'phish', which means fish. Placing bait to catch fish is a common phenomenon. Phishing works similarly. Tricking users or victims into clicking on malicious websites is an unethical practice."
  },
  {
    "id": "60",
    "question": "What do you mean by Forward Secrecy and how does it work?",
    "answer": "Forward secrecy is a feature of some key agreement protocols that guarantees that the session keys will remain secure even if the server's private key is compromised. Perfect forward secrecy, also known as PFS, is the term used to describe this. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is employed to achieve this. "
